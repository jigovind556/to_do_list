# Todo List Web App with User Authentication

This project is a Todo List web application with user authentication features. Users can sign up for an account, log in, and manage their tasks. The application uses local storage to simulate user accounts.

## Features

- User Registration and Login
- Authentication State Management
- Task Management (Create, Edit, Complete, Delete)
- Task Persistence in Local Storage
- Logout Functionality

## Getting Started

## Security Considerations

- User-specific data segregation

- HTTPS is recommended for production deployment

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- Due dates for tasks
- Task prioritization
- Filtering tasks by status (completed/active)
